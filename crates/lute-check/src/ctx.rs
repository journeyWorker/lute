//! subject inside a `match`; T4.4 (def-assignment §8.1), T4.5 (app-write

/// The statically-known expected type of a CEL slot's value, when derivable.

/// `None` means "no constraint, never flag". `E-REF-TYPE` is only ever emitted
/// when BOTH an expected type is known AND the slot's `@name` resolves to a
/// known def type in [`Ctx::def_types`].
///
/// # Purpose — B2.2 `E-REF-TYPE` (dsl §8)
///
/// A CEL slot may reference a frontmatter/plugin def via `@name`. Each def
/// declares the [`Type`] it PRODUCES. When the slot sits in a position with a
/// statically-known expected type, B2.2 compares the def's produced type against
/// the expected type (see the compatibility relation below) and emits
/// `E-REF-TYPE` on a CLEAR mismatch. This design task adds the model only; no
/// diagnostic is emitted yet.
///
/// # Per-`CelKind` derivation (`lute-syntax/src/ast.rs:147-153`)
///
/// `CelKind` has exactly four variants. For each, whether an expected type is
/// statically known, and how B2.2 derives it:
///
/// * **`Condition` ⇒ `ExpectedType::Bool` — ALWAYS (statically known).**
///   The kind alone fixes the type: `<when test=…>` arm guards
///   (`Arm::When.test`, ast.rs:86-91; checked at `check.rs:342`),
///   `<choice when=…>` guards (`Choice.when`, ast.rs:72; `check.rs:309`), and any
///   other boolean guard all expect `bool`. Highest confidence — no schema
///   lookup, no threading. `Arm::Otherwise` (ast.rs:92-95) carries no test, so
///   there is no slot to type there.
///
/// * **`SetExpr` ⇒ `ExpectedType::Ty(target_path_type)` when resolvable, else
///   unknown (statically known iff the target path is in the schema).**
///   The `::set` node is `Set { path: String, expr: CelSlot, .. }`
///   (ast.rs:51-58; checked at `check.rs:300` / `check.rs:370`). B2.2 looks the
///   RHS's expected type up via `set_op::resolve_type(&set.path, &ctx.state)`
///   (`set_op.rs:102`) — the target path's declared [`Type`], resolved by exact
///   `state:` key OR by descending `Record` fields / `Map` values from the
///   nearest declared ancestor (so a nested target like `scene.player.hp` under
///   a declared `scene.player` record resolves), NOT a flat `ctx.state.decls.get`
///   exact-key lookup. A compound or
///   derived RHS (`a + b`, a ternary, …) still expects the SINGLE declared type
///   of the target path — the whole expression must evaluate to that type. If
///   `set.path` is absent from the schema, the expected type is unknown (no flag;
///   the missing path itself is a separate `E-UNDECLARED`-class concern).
///
/// * **`AttrValue` (a `@ref` used as a directive attribute value) ⇒
///   `ExpectedType::Ty(attr_declared_type)` when the owning directive + attr are
///   known, else unknown.** The attr's type is
///   `snapshot.directive(tag)` (snapshot.rs:37-39) → the matching
///   `AttrDecl { name, ty, .. }` (`DirectiveDecl.attrs`, schema.rs:50-54;
///   `AttrDecl.ty`, schema.rs:66-72).
///   **THREADING COST (explicit):** a `CelSlot` does NOT carry its owning
///   directive tag or attr name (ast.rs:141-162), so the expected type CANNOT be
///   derived inside `check_cel_slot` (`cel_resolve.rs:30`). B2.2 must compute it
///   at the CALL SITE `check_attr_refs` (`check.rs:381-386`), where the owning
///   `Directive.tag` and `Attr.key` are in scope, and pass it in. This is why
///   B2.2 gives `check_cel_slot` an `expected: Option<&ExpectedType>` parameter
///   rather than having it derive the type internally — the slot is context-free.
///
/// * **`MatchSubject` ⇒ `ExpectedType::Ty(subject_path_type)` when the subject is
///   a single state path with a known type, else unknown.** The subject is
///   `Match.subject: CelSlot` (ast.rs:78-83; checked at `check.rs:327`). B2.2
///   resolves `subject.raw` via `set_op::resolve_type` exactly as `SetExpr` does
///   (exact key OR descend `Record`/`Map` from the nearest declared ancestor); a
///   compound subject expression (not a single resolvable path) has no single
///   expected type ⇒ unknown.
///
/// So `Condition` is unconditionally statically known; `SetExpr`, `AttrValue`,
/// and `MatchSubject` are statically known only when their respective lookup
/// (state schema / directive-attr decl) resolves, and unknown otherwise.
///
/// # Def-type sources (populating [`Ctx::def_types`] in B2.2)
///
/// * **Plugin defs — already typed, direct.** `snapshot.defs: BTreeMap<String,
///   DefDecl>` (snapshot.rs:19); `DefDecl.ty: Type` (schema.rs:167-170) is a
///   ready `Type`. Insert `(name, ty.clone())` directly.
/// * **Inline frontmatter `defs:` — stored UNTYPED.** `parse_meta` keeps them as
///   `TypedMeta.defs: BTreeMap<String, serde_yaml::Value>` (`crate::meta`,
///   meta.rs:44; populated meta.rs:152). Each value is a mapping like
///   `{ type: bool, cel: "…" }` (see `docs/examples/bianca-s01ep02.lute:14-15`:
///   `fond: { type: bool, cel: "scene.affect.bianca >= 1" }`). B2.2 pulls the
///   `type:` sub-value and deserializes it into `Type` via the SAME serde path
///   `Type` uses (the `TypeDef` singleton-map shadow, `types.rs:149-270`), e.g.
///   `serde_yaml::from_value::<Type>(v.get("type")?.clone()).ok()`. A
///   malformed/absent `type:` yields NO entry — never a panic.
///
/// # `ctx.defs` vs `def_types` (two tables, one union source)
///
/// [`Ctx::defs`] (the `E-UNDECLARED-REF` set) is the UNION of inline frontmatter
/// def names (`typed.defs.keys()`), plugin-exported def names
/// (`snapshot.defs.keys()`), and imported-schema def names
/// (`imports.defs.keys()`) — see `check.rs:207-209`. `def_types` is a parallel
/// table mapping the subset of those names with a known produced [`Type`]. A
/// name may be in `defs` without a `def_types` entry (untyped/malformed
/// `type:`), so the two are consulted independently: `E-REF-TYPE` fires ONLY
/// when a name is present in `def_types` AND an expected type is known.
///
/// # Compatibility relation — `compatible(produced: &Type, expected: &ExpectedType) -> bool` (B2.2)
///
/// CONSERVATIVE by construction: return `true` (no flag) for everything not
/// PROVABLY incompatible. The decided relation:
///
/// * `expected == ExpectedType::Bool` ⇒ compatible iff `produced == Type::Bool`.
///   This is the canonical positive case to flag: a def producing `Number` used
///   in `<when test="@count">` where `count: number` — `produced == Number !=
///   Bool` ⇒ INCOMPATIBLE ⇒ `E-REF-TYPE`.
/// * `expected == ExpectedType::Ty(t)`:
///   1. **Id types are always compatible (never flag).** If EITHER `t` or
///      `produced` is `ProviderRef(_)`, `SlotId { .. }`, or `AssetKind(_)`
///      (types.rs:19-22, all attribute-only / namespaced id types), treat as
///      unknown and return `true`. DECISION + JUSTIFICATION: these carry a
///      namespaced/provider identity that a def's produced `Type` and def-CEL
///      string production cannot be shown to satisfy here; their value-level form
///      is a string, but membership/namespace validity is a separate concern
///      E-REF-TYPE deliberately does not attempt. Folding them into the string
///      family (the other option) would risk false positives (e.g. `Str`-vs-
///      `SlotId`) for no real gain, since defs almost never declare an id type —
///      so "always compatible" is the strictly-safer call.
///   2. **String family is mutually compatible.** Else if BOTH `produced` and `t`
///      are in `{ Str, Enum(_), EnumFromOption(_) }`, return `true`. An enum value
///      IS a string at the value level and def CEL produces string-ish values;
///      E-REF-TYPE does not do enum-membership checking (a value-level concern).
///   3. **Otherwise structural equality.** Compatible iff `produced == t`
///      (`Type` derives `PartialEq`, types.rs:10 — structural over the whole
///      shape, incl. `List`/`Record`/`Map`). This flags clear mismatches like
///      `Number` vs `Bool`, `Number` vs `List(_)`, `Bool` vs `Str`.
/// * Anything not resolving to a clear incompatibility ⇒ compatible (no flag).
///
/// # Scope guidance for the design gate
///
/// If the reviewer/user find the full model too broad, B2.2 can ship a CLEAN
/// SUBSET: `Condition ⇒ Bool` + `SetExpr ⇒ target-path type` ONLY, deferring
/// `AttrValue` and `MatchSubject`. This is a strict prefix — SAME `ExpectedType`,
/// SAME `compatible`, SAME `def_types` — differing only in how many call sites
/// populate `expected`. `Condition`/`SetExpr` need no extra threading (the slot
/// kind and the `Set.path` are already at the call site), whereas `AttrValue`
/// needs the owning directive/attr threaded to `check_attr_refs` and
/// `MatchSubject` needs single-path subject resolution. Narrowing therefore costs
/// zero rework and is a clean subset of this design.

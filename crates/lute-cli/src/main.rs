//! `lute` — the headless CLI wrapper around the `check()` core (Phase 5).
//!
//! Two subcommands, both thin shells over library code (arch: "`check()` is the
//! contract, not the LSP protocol" — the CLI adds argument parsing, file I/O, and
//! output formatting, and owns NO validation logic):
//!
//! - `lute check <file> [--json] [--providers <dir>]` — statically validate one
//!   `.lute` document against the built-in `lute.core` snapshot plus an optional
//!   pinned provider catalog. Exit `0` when clean, `1` when any `Error`-severity
//!   diagnostic is present (`CheckResult::ok`), `2` on an I/O failure. `--json`
//!   prints the serialized [`CheckResult`]; otherwise a human line per diagnostic.
//! - `lute check-project <dir> [--json] [--providers <dir>]` — recursively
//!   `check` every `*.lute` file under `<dir>` (deterministic sorted order),
//!   resolving EACH file's project root independently as its nearest
//!   ancestor directory containing a `lute.project.yaml` (bounded below by
//!   `<dir>` itself; falls back to `<dir>` when no ancestor has one) — so a
//!   `<dir>` containing nested subprojects checks each file against ITS OWN
//!   subproject, not the walk root. PLUS project-wide `<quest id>`
//!   uniqueness (dsl 0.2.0 §6.3), scoped PER RESOLVED PROJECT ROOT (two
//!   different subprojects declaring the same id is not a collision), for
//!   quest docs `check`'s own import-graph-scoped `E-QUEST-ID-DUP` (0.2.0
//!   F4) cannot see: two quest docs sharing an id with no `uses:`/`extends:`
//!   edge between them. ALSO, PER RESOLVED PROJECT ROOT, `W-QUEST-REF-UNKNOWN`
//!   (dsl 0.5.1 §1.4): every referenced reserved `quest.<id>.state` /
//!   `quest.<id>.objectives.<oid>.done` path across the root's docs must
//!   resolve to a quest (and objective) some quest doc in the root DEFINES —
//!   a WARNING (never flips the exit verdict) naming the referencing
//!   document and the unresolved path; single-file `lute check` has no
//!   project graph and never emits it. Exit `0` clean, `1` when any file has
//!   an `Error` or any resolved root's quest-id pass finds a collision, `2`
//!   on an I/O failure. `--json` prints a structured report (per-file
//!   `CheckResult`s + the project-wide diagnostics); otherwise per-file
//!   human lines plus a project-wide section.
//! - `lute catalog refresh <dir>` — re-stamp every pinned provider snapshot in
//!   `<dir>` against the current `capabilityVersion` and clear its `stale` flag,
//!   rewriting each file in the flat on-disk format `ProviderSet::load` reads
//!   (plugin §10; "an explicit `catalog refresh` precedes a build"). Correctness
//!   never depends on a live/remote catalog — refresh only canonicalizes and
//!   re-stamps the already-pinned artifacts, so `refresh` then `load` round-trips.

/// - `producible()` is a monotone least-fixpoint over its own base-case
///   assert-site seeds -> fewer live asserts can only shrink the
